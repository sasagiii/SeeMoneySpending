# SeeMoneySpending
This project was created to cater to individuals like my mum who prefer using cash for most of their transactions. The motivation behind this project stemmed from my mum's desire to avoid the guilt associated with seeing unnecessary expenses in a bank app. Additionally, she wanted a simple and user-friendly alternative to the fancy and complicated apps available in the market.
